# FAQ

## Why is the bot not responding?

Check the following before asking for help on the [support server](https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw).

* Make sure the bot is online. Discord might be having issues, or the bot might be restarting.
* Make sure the bot has the _Administrator_ permission.

## How do I change the prefix?

You can't change the prefix of the bot currently. If another bot coincidentally has the same prefix as Member Count, you can mention the bot with the command. For example: `@Member Count#7205 ping`.

## How do I change the counter name?

This feature is for premium only. You can donate [here](https://www.patreon.com/member_count). The command to change the counter name is `m!countername <counter> <name>`.

## Why is the bot not updating the channel name?

Make sure the bot is online, and that it has the _Administrator_ permission. Then try `m!setup` to reset the channels back to default. If this still does not work, tell us on the [support server](https://discord.gg/dWMgWWw).

## Can I change the bot's username and avatar?

No, username and avatar are global. Changing it will affect all servers Member Count is on. You can only change the bot's nickname under _Manage User_, if you have the _Manage Nicknames_ permission.

## Can I self-host the bot?

No, you can't. The bot's code is closed source.
